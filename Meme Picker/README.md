Created a program for users to choose an emotion and output cat memes w/o animated gifts

Recap
-for of: Nicer way to iterating through an array
-import/export: importing/exporting large files
-radio & checkbox inputs: types of selections that user can click on
-querySelector: being able to choose specific elements without id's
-getElementsByClassName: remember to itreate because classes may be associated with more than 1 elements.
Remember that class is multiple while id's is just limited to one, thus why we iterate
-classList.remove/add: we can add and remove classes in objects
-includes: basically checks whether an array has a certain thing
-.filter(): filters an array, only keeping the things that you want in the array
