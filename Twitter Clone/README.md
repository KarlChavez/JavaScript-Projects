Made a twitter clone based on scrimba called Twimba!

Recap
1. **textrea** multiline input
2. **data attributes** storing information inside an element and that enabled us to tell which tweet an icon belonged to
3. **conditionally rendered styles** we set up a let variable and depending on, lets say an icon way liked, we could add the class of coloring it read using inner html
4. **CDN** Content delivery networks. We added fonts and a function that generated UUIDs
