Created a cookie consent website that takes in your information and steals it (jk it doesn't actually do that lol)

Essential JS concepts in this projects
- setTimeout: which is basically a timer
- element.style: dynamically update a css property
- forms: input, type, name, placeholder, etc..
- formData & .get(): formData holds data from our form and .get() gets data
- event.preventDefault: more control of where the form data foes (not on the url)
- CSS: row-reverse - flips direction using display: flex property
- toggling classes: turning on and off a class in an element
- "disabled" attribute: makes it so user can't interact with it
